## Finding Your Service Mesh Configuration Files

### Istio MeshConfig Files

Istio MeshConfig is typically stored as a Kubernetes ConfigMap. To extract it:

```bash
# Check current MeshConfig
kubectl -n istio-system get configmap istio -o jsonpath='{.data.mesh}' > istio-meshconfig.yaml

# For older versions, you might need to use:
kubectl -n istio-system get cm istio -o yaml > istio-meshconfig.yaml

# For IstioOperator configs:
kubectl -n istio-operator get IstioOperator installed-state -o yaml > istio-operator-config.yaml
```

### Consul Service Mesh Configuration Files

Consul configurations can be found in various locations depending on your setup:

```bash
# For Kubernetes-based Consul:
kubectl -n consul get configmap consul-server -o jsonpath='{.data.server\.json}' > consul-config.json

# For standalone Consul instances:
# Get main configuration
consul config read -name default > consul-config.json

# List all service configurations
consul config list -kind service-defaults

# Get specific service configuration
consul config read -kind service-defaults -name <service-name> > service-config.json

# For local file-based configuration, typically found at:
cat /etc/consul/consul.hcl > consul-config.hcl
# or
cat /etc/consul/consul.d/*.json > consul-config.json
```

### Linkerd Configuration Files

Linkerd configurations can be extracted using the Linkerd CLI or Kubernetes commands:

```bash
# Get main Linkerd configuration
linkerd install --dry-run > linkerd-config.yaml

# For Kubernetes-based installations:
kubectl -n linkerd get cm linkerd-config -o yaml > linkerd-config.yaml

# For proxy configurations:
kubectl -n linkerd get cm linkerd-proxy-config -o jsonpath='{.data.config\.yaml}' > linkerd-proxy-config.yaml

# For identity configurations:
kubectl -n linkerd get secret linkerd-identity-issuer -o yaml > linkerd-identity-config.yaml
```

When in doubt, use the relevant CLI tool's export or dump functionality to get your configuration in a readable format for analysis.

## Key Security Guidelines

### Istio Security Guidelines

When configuring your Istio mesh, follow these key security guidelines:

1. **Always use STRICT mTLS mode** for service-to-service communication
2. **Enable RBAC** for authorization control
3. **Set outbound traffic policy to REGISTRY_ONLY** to prevent unauthorized external communication
4. **Avoid running proxies in privileged mode** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Enable telemetry and access logging** for security monitoring
6. **Use proper certificate management** with SDS enabled and appropriate validity periods
7. **Hold application starts until proxy is ready** to prevent traffic leaks
8. **Use custom trust domains** to isolate identities
9. **Apply a default deny authorization policy** and explicitly allow required traffic
10. **Use external certificate authorities** for production environments

### Consul Security Guidelines

When configuring your Consul service mesh, follow these key security guidelines:

1. **Enable Consul Connect** for service mesh capabilities
2. **Do not allow privileged proxy mode** unless absolutely necessary
3. **Use external certificate authorities** for production environments
4. **Set appropriate certificate TTL values** based on security requirements
5. **Enable TLS verification** for both incoming and outgoing connections
6. **Enable TLS hostname verification** to prevent MITM attacks
7. **Enable and properly configure the ACL system** with a default deny policy
8. **Set specific tokens with appropriate permissions** for agents and defaults
9. **Enable service metrics** for security monitoring
10. **Configure auto-encrypt and auto-config features** for secure operation

### Linkerd Security Guidelines

When configuring your Linkerd service mesh, follow these key security guidelines:

1. **Always enable and enforce TLS** for all service-to-service communication
2. **Use only strong cipher suites** and disable weak/deprecated algorithms
3. **Set minimum TLS version to 1.2 or higher** to prevent known vulnerabilities
4. **Enable service identity features** for proper service authentication
5. **Consider using external certificate authorities** for production environments
6. **Configure shorter certificate validity periods** with regular rotation
7. **Provide proper trust anchors** for certificate validation
8. **Avoid running proxies in privileged mode** unless absolutely necessary
9. **Enable policy enforcement** with default deny and explicit allows
10. **Use strict authentication mode** to require authentication for all traffic
11. **Enable observability features** for security monitoring and incident response
12. **Configure TLS in all destination rules** to prevent plaintext traffic

### FedRAMP Compliance Guidelines

For environments requiring FedRAMP compliance, additional security measures are necessary:

1. **Use TLS 1.2 or higher** with FIPS-compliant cipher suites
2. **Enable gossip encryption** with a strong encryption key
3. **Verify all gossip communication** by enabling both incoming and outgoing verification
4. **Enable audit logging** to capture all security-relevant events
5. **Use secure bootstrapping** to prevent tampering during cluster initialization
6. **Configure certificate rotation** with appropriate periods
7. **Restrict service proxies** to only communicate with localhost services
8. **Enforce sidecar proxies** for all services to ensure mTLS
9. **Set ACL default policy to "deny"** and allow only required operations
10. **Implement regular encryption key rotation** for gossip and TLS certificates

## Security Best Practices Without Direct NIST Mappings

Some security recommendations implemented in the analyzer may not have direct NIST 800-53 control mappings but are still important security best practices. Here's why we recommend these practices:

### Resource Configuration Best Practices

1. **Pinning Container Image Versions**: Using specific versions rather than `:latest` tags ensures predictable behavior and prevents unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.

2. **Timeout Configuration**: Setting appropriate timeouts prevents resource exhaustion and potential denial of service conditions by limiting how long connections remain open.

3. **Resource Limits**: Configuring CPU and memory limits prevents individual components from consuming excessive resources, which could impact the availability of other services.

### Service Mesh Specific Best Practices

1. **Trust Domain Configuration** (Istio): Setting explicit trust domains isolates identities and prevents potential cross-domain impersonation attacks.

2. **Proxy Initialization Sequencing** (Istio): Ensuring proxies initialize before applications prevents traffic leakage outside the mesh during startup.

3. **Service Account Token Volume Projection** (Linkerd): Using projected service account tokens with expiration enhances security over traditional, non-expiring service account tokens.

4. **Certificate Rotation Frequency**: Setting shorter certificate validity periods limits the exposure window if certificates are compromised.

5. **Auto-Config Security** (Consul): Enabling secure bootstrapping for configuration prevents tampering during initialization.

These practices have evolved from real-world experiences operating service meshes in production environments and represent the collective knowledge of the service mesh community around secure deployments.
